## Project Goal and Description:
Velocity is designed to be used as phone app and utilizes three data models to help users browse through a large assortment of quotes from famous authors, and choose ten as the ones that resonate the  most with them, and save them to their Velocity Board. Users are also able to save quotes that don't make that ten limit cut to a larger and unlimited general quote board that is unique to each user.

Through this exercise, I really came to appreciate the component model and component based framework of React. There were specific fields that I had to repeat manually during this project that helped me clearly visualize by the end of this project how instead, I could have turned many of them into reusable components. I plan to take this insight with me going forward. 

The three models. User ->  Values ->
<br/>
                    User -> Quotes-> Values
                    
## Future Directions, things not got to:
* In the future, I would like to create media queries to make the site more accessible as a laptop or talet user. 

* Utilize more turnaries in setting the framework of components.

* Create a past values array and display to store user's past values

* Extract author names of quotes and recommend book titles to user based on those names.

* Utilize unique fonts. 

* Integrate an authentication method to utilize passwords

* Allow users to rank their values from one to ten manually, utilzing for loops in the back end of the app.
